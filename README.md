Problem ccc06j1 from DMOJ

"At Chip's Fast Food emporium there is a very simple menu. Each food item is selected by entering a digit choice.

Here are the three burger choices:
1 – Cheeseburger (461 Calories)
2 – Fish Burger (431 Calories)
3 – Veggie Burger (420 Calories)
4 – no burger	

Here are the three drink choices:
1 – Soft Drink (130 Calories)
2 – Orange Juice (160 Calories)
3 – Milk (118 Calories)
4 – no drink

Here are the three side order choices:
1 – Fries (100 Calories)
2 – Baked Potato (57 Calories)
3 – Chef Salad (70 Calories)
4 – no side order	

Here are the three dessert choices:
1 – Apple Pie (167 Calories)
2 – Sundae (266 Calories)
3 – Fruit Cup (75 Calories)
4 – no dessert

Write a program that will compute the total Calories of a meal."

Input Specification:
The program should input a number for each type of item then calculate and display the Calorie total. The first line will be the customer's choice of burger, the second will be the choice of side, then drink, then dessert. You may assume that each input will be a number from 1 to 4. That is, each customer has to pick exactly one number from each of the four options out of each of the four categories.

Output Specification:
The program prints out the total Calories of the selected meal, and stops executing after this output.
